## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local disk.

2. Download Xcode from [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) (It’s much faster than from Mac App Store). Alternatively, you can use the [Xcodes App](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/XcodesApp) to download Xcode directly.

3. Navigate to the locale file you want to help translate, double-click to open it with Xcode.

4. Enter the translation in the langugage column. It’s next to the “Default Localization (en)” column.

5. Translate all the six files until there’re no “NEW” states left in the files.

6. You can choose to add your name and link to the **Acknowledgements** section. It will appear in the app.

7. Open a pull request.

## Notes

1. Stick to the official Apple terminology if possible. For example, your language may have multiple translations for “Paste”. Choose the one Apple uses in macOS. You can reference native apps by Apple like Notes, Finder, Safari or [Apple Localization Terms Glossary](https://applelocalization.com/).

2. You can use use online service like Google Translate, Deepl or whatever you find suitable. But do review the results.
